# PICAT
PiCat is a custom devboard created with help from HackClub! The board is completely custom, running on an RP2040 and is connected to 16MB of flash memory and two 5mm LEDs that can be controlled. PCBs were created in KICAD and renders were created using Blender (renders have out of date silkscreen, but should otherwise be identical to the pcb).

I created this project gain experience working on PCBs while creating a product I will use. I plan to use at least one of the two devboards as an LED controller in a 3d printed lamp, and the other one will be used for a future project. 

## PCB and Schematics
PCBs were created competely by hand in KICAD.
